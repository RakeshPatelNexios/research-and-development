1. Use the pagehide and visibilitychange Events
You can listen for these events to detect when the user navigates away or switches tabs and handle ongoing IndexedDB operations gracefully.

// Listen for page visibility changes
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
    if (document.visibilityState === 'hidden') {
        console.log('Page is hidden (user switched tabs or minimized the window).');
        // Save any unsaved data or pause ongoing operations
    } else {
        console.log('Page is visible again.');
        // Resume operations if needed
    }
});

// Listen for page unload (user navigates away or closes the tab)
window.addEventListener('pagehide', () => {
    console.log('Page is being unloaded.');
    // Save any unsaved data or abort ongoing operations
});


2. Use Transactions with complete and abort Events
IndexedDB transactions have complete and abort events that you can use to handle success and failure scenarios.

const transaction = db.transaction([storeName], 'readwrite');
const store = transaction.objectStore(storeName);

// Add data
const request = store.add({ name: 'Jane Doe', age: 25 });

// Handle transaction completion
transaction.oncomplete = () => {
    console.log('Transaction completed successfully.');
};

// Handle transaction abortion
transaction.onabort = (event) => {
    console.error('Transaction was aborted:', event.target.error);
};

If the user navigates away while a transaction is ongoing, the onabort event will fire, and you can handle it appropriately (e.g., retry the operation later).


3. Use a Service Worker for Background Operations
If you need to perform IndexedDB operations even when the page is closed, you can use a Service Worker. Service Workers run in the background and can handle tasks like syncing data or caching.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use a Service Worker to handle IndexedDB operations:

Service Worker Script (sw.js):

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
    console.log('Service Worker installed.');
});

self.addEventListener('activate', (event) => {
    console.log('Service Worker activated.');
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
    console.log('Fetch event intercepted.');
    // You can handle fetch events and interact with IndexedDB here
});


Register the Service Worker in Your Main Script:

if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
        .then((registration) => {
            console.log('Service Worker registered:', registration);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
            console.error('Service Worker registration failed:', error);
        });
}

With a Service Worker, you can perform IndexedDB operations in the background, even when the user navigates away from the page.


4. Save Data Before Unload
If you want to ensure data is saved before the user navigates away, you can use the beforeunload event.

window.addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {
    console.log('Page is about to unload.');
    // Save any unsaved data to IndexedDB
    const transaction = db.transaction([storeName], 'readwrite');
    const store = transaction.objectStore(storeName);
    store.put({ id: 1, name: 'Last Minute Save', age: 40 });

    // Optionally, prevent the page from unloading immediately
    event.preventDefault();
    event.returnValue = ''; // Required for some browsers
});


Summary of Behavior
Q. Scenario : Switch to another tab
A. IndexedDB operations continue, but may be throttled by the browser.

Q. Scenario : Navigate away or close tab
A. Ongoing IndexedDB transactions are aborted.

Q. Page refresh
A. All IndexedDB connections are closed, and transactions are aborted.

Q. Service Worker in use
A. IndexedDB operations can continue in the background even if the page is closed.


Best Practices
1. Graceful Abort Handling:
Always handle the onabort event for transactions to avoid data loss.

2. Save Data Frequently:
Use visibilitychange and beforeunload events to save data before the user navigates away.

3. Use Service Workers:
For offline-first applications, use Service Workers to handle IndexedDB operations in the background.

4. Test Across Browsers:
Different browsers may handle IndexedDB differently when the page is inactive, so test your application thoroughly.
